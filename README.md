# lein-gorildown

A Leiningen plugin to convert all the [Gorilla REPL](http://gorilla-repl.org/) files in the project or specified directory to the raw Markdown files, based on [ksseono/gorildown](https://github.com/ksseono/gorildown) project.

Gorilla REPL provide [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) like web UI and save the notebooks in the Clojure files with some comments following its own notations to render notebook styles later. 

But it's not convinient when you want to share others the notebooks as they are and also it's not a good way to force others to use Gorilla REPL only to look throught the content. 

`lein-gorildown` convert the Gorilla REPL files(notebooks) in your project into the raw Markdown files so that you can easily share them. You can check the sample results [here](https://github.com/ksseono/lein-gorildown/tree/master/examples).
